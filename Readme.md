# Features:

- **Product Fetching** :Fetches and displays products from the DummyJSON API(https://dummyjson.com/products).
- **Responsive Layout**: Products adjust to different screen sizes. 
- **Basic Styling**: Clean UI with cards for each product (image, title, description, price).  
- **Sorting Functionality**: Sort the products according to-
    ->Price: Low-High/High-Low.
    ->Rating: Low-High/High-Low.
